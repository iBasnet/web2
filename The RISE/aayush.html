    <h1> Hello Everyone, Welcome </h1>
    <p><strong> This is all about Myself: </strong> <br> My name is Aayush Kharel from Bharatpur 10, Chitwan, Nepal. My
        home town name is Chitwan. I am currently a College student studying in <em>Class 11</em>. I have just finished
        my SEE securing A+(3.85)GPA. For my college, I have choseen <strong>Valmiki Shiksha Sadan</strong>, an Institute
        where excellence Prevails. There was an entrance among 1000 students to study 11,+2 in Valmiki Shiksha Sadan and
        I had also participated. Although I wasn't able to get into top 10 students, I was able to make it out being
        20th position student, which was actually good because It wasn't that easy among 1000 students. </p>
